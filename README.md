## ðŸš€ **Setup Instructions**

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clinikk-frontend.git
cd clinikk-frontend
npm install(to install all dependencies)
npm run dev(this will start the development server in localhost:5173)
keep the backend running as this frontend is working on local backend,
so this will fetch data when the backend server is running(on localhost:3000)
also try to keep file size 5-50mb or less than 100mb
file format should be strictly .mp4(and not HD)
